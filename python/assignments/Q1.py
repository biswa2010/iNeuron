#Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

"""

Python doesn't interact with the machine directly with the machine rather through the interpreter which makes it a HLL. 
Also python is known as a general purpose programming language as it's not for any specific problems but we can use this for
ML, AI, data engineering, software development etc.
